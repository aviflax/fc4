  "Starts a hawk watch and returns the watch object, enriched with a few keys
  specific to this workflow: :executor and :active-set. You can pass the result
  to the function `stop` to stop both the executor and hawkâ€™s background thread,
  after which they should be garbage-collected, if you donâ€™t hold on to a
  reference.

  process-fn must be a single-arity (or variable-arity) function that accepts a
  File object pointing to a file thatâ€™s been changed and should be processed. It
  may do I/O and may block. It may change the file. It may throw exceptions. Its
  return value is ignored; itâ€™s invoked for its side effects.

  The watch routine will automatically print (to *out*) the file name before
  invoking the function (followed by a semicolon and a space) but itâ€™s the
  responsibility of process-fn to print anything beyond that: progress, success,
  error, failure, etc â€” including a newline char (\\n) at the end of its output,
  which it *really* should do."
