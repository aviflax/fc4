# Some of the jobs below include a step named “Permissions workaround”. To explain:
#
# This section of this page:
# https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#docker-container-filesystem
# contains this note:
#
# > GitHub Actions must be run by the default Docker user (root). Ensure your Dockerfile does not
# > set the USER instruction, otherwise you will not be able to access GITHUB_WORKSPACE.
#
# Unfortunately the images we’re using violate this advice — they include `USER circleci`.
#
# So this step is an attempt to ensure that the user `circleci` will be able to write to the dirs to
# which it needs to write. I guess it’s a hack or a band-aid or whatever, but it does seem to work.
