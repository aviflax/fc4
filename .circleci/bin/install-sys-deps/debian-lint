# This script is for installing system dependencies needed to lint the tool on Debian Linux.

# We only lint on the Debian Linux OpenJDK images provided by CircleCI, and those already have JDK
# 11 installed. So we just need to install Clojure.

# That said, it can’t hurt to verify that Java is installed.
# If java isn’t installed, the script will exit, because of the set -e above.
java --version >> /dev/null

# OK, now let’s install Clojure.
