; Require image-resizer.core while preventing the Java app icon from popping up
; and grabbing focus on MacOS.
; Approach found here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17460777/stop-java-coffee-cup-icon-from-appearing-in-the-dock-on-mac-osx/17544259#comment48475681_17544259
; This require is here rather than in the ns form at the top of the file because
; if I include this ns in the require list in the ns form, then the only way to
; suppress the app icon from popping up and grabbing focus would be to place the
; System/setProperty call at the top of the file, before the ns form, and that’d
; violate Clojure idioms. When people open a clj file, they expect to see a ns
; form right at the top declaring which namespace the file defines and
; populates.
; To be clear, calling the `require` function in a clj file, to require a
; dependency, outside of the ns form, is *also* non-idiomatic; people expect all
; of the dependencies of a file to be listed in the ns form. So I had to choose
; between two non-idiomatic solutions; I chose this one because it seems to me
; to be slightly less jarring for Clojurists.
