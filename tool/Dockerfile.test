# This Dockerfile is intended for running the tests.
#
# It isn’t useful for _using_ the tool because:
#
# * the tool itself has far fewer system-level requirements at runtime
#   * most meaningfully it does not require Clojure or Node to be installed
# * but it does requires access to your files.

# This base image is documented here: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/circleci-images/

# We need to create the working dir explicitly via mkdir, rather than just let WORKDIR create it
# (or it might actually be created lazily by e.g. COPY) because if we let WORKDIR (or maybe COPY)
# create it, it gets created via root with the wrong permissions and then the user that’s used for
# all the RUN commands (circleci) can’t write to it. This is *really* annoying.

# re-download deps every time the app code changes.
