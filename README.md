# The FC4 Framework

<!-- Using a table because I want the image to “float” to the right. I tried to do so with an inline
style on the img tag (or a wrapping figure tag) — but no dice. It looks like GitHub Pages strips
inline CSS. Understandable. So while this is kinda ugly, it more or less works. -->

FC4 is a <a href="https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/"><i>Docs as Code</i></a>
framework that enables software creators to author, publish, and maintain software architecture
diagrams more effectively, efficiently, and collaboratively over time.

It has two components:

<ul>
  <li><a href="methodology/">the methodology</a>
  <li><a href="tool/">the tool</a>
</ul>

</td><td>

<img src="https://fundingcircle.github.io/fc4-framework/tool/doc/fc4-tool-container.png"
     width="60%"
     height="60%"
     alt="Example: a container diagram of fc4-tool."
     title="Example: a container diagram of fc4-tool.">

</td></tr></table>

It builds on [the C4 Model](https://c4model.com/) and [Structurizr Express](https://structurizr.com/express), both of which were created by and are maintained by [Simon Brown](http://simonbrown.je/).

It originated at and is maintained by [Funding Circle](https://engineering.fundingcircle.com/).

To get started, we recommend reading [the methodology](methodology/). If you have any questions or feedback please [create an issue](https://github.com/FundingCircle/fc4-framework/issues/new) and one of the maintainers will get back to you shortly.

## The Name

FC4 is not ([yet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym)) an acronym or initialism; it doesn’t stand for anything — it’s “just” a name.

The name is a combination of “FC” and “C4” — the former is a reference to Funding Circle, the originating context of the framework; the latter to Simon Brown’s C4 model, the foundation of the framework.
