# The Name

FC4 is not ([yet][backronym]) an acronym or initialism; it doesn’t stand for anything — it’s “just”
a name.

The name is a combination of “FC” and “C4” — the former is a reference to [Funding Circle][fc], the
originating context of the tool; the latter to Simon Brown’s [C4 model][c4-model], the foundation of
the tool.
