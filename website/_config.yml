# Required by GitHub Pages if/when a repo doesn’t have a remote named `origin` pointing to a GitHub
# repo. Which is how I have my local repo set up. (In my case I‘ve named the remote gh-fundingcircle
# as in general I think something with `gh` or `github` jives better than `origin` with the ethos of
# Git.)
repository: FundingCircle/fc4-framework

# GitHub pages could derive these from the repo for us, but I prefer to override them with these
# values, for now, because the name and description of the repo are temporarily a little out of sync
# with the newer language in these docs.
